const traderFAQs = [
  {
    q: 'what is a continuous clearing auction?',
    a: `A Continuous Clearing Auction (CCA) is a fair price discovery mechanism where all participants pay the exact same final price, regardless of when they bid or how much they bid.

Unlike traditional auctions where early bidders might get better prices or snipers swoop in at the last second, CCAs calculate a single "clearing price" at the end based on total demand divided by available supply.

This eliminates timing games, front-running, and MEV extraction that plague traditional token sales. The auction runs for approximately 30 minutes, continuously updating the clearing price as new bids come in.`,
    tag: 'core',
  },
  {
    q: 'how does pricing actually work?',
    a: `The clearing price is determined by a simple formula: total USDC bid divided by total tokens available.

For example, if $500,000 USDC is bid into an auction for 100,000 tokens, the clearing price becomes $5 per token.

There's also a time-weighting component that benefits early bidders. Bids placed earlier accumulate more "weight" over time, meaning early participants receive slightly better effective allocations. This incentivizes early commitment rather than last-second speculation.`,
    tag: 'core',
  },
  {
    q: 'how do i place a bid?',
    a: `Connect your wallet, navigate to the token you want to bid on, and enter the amount of USDC you wish to commit.

The platform uses Permit2 for gasless approvals, so you'll sign a message and then submit your bid transaction. Once submitted, your USDC is locked until the auction concludes.

You can view your active bids and their status on the token page at any time. There's no minimum bid amount, but very small bids may not be economical after gas costs.`,
    tag: 'guide',
  },
  {
    q: 'can i cancel or modify my bid?',
    a: `No, bids are irrevocable once submitted. This is a deliberate design choice to prevent manipulation.

If participants could cancel freely, bad actors could artificially inflate demand to drive up the clearing price, then withdraw at the last moment to harm other bidders.

You can, however, place additional bids on the same auction. Each new bid is treated independently and adds to your total commitment.`,
    tag: 'rules',
  },
  {
    q: 'when and how do i receive my tokens?',
    a: `After the auction ends, there's a short waiting period while the protocol finalizes the clearing price and migrates liquidity to Uniswap V4.

This typically takes around 10-20 blocks. Once claims are enabled, visit the token page and click the claim button to receive your allocated tokens.

If the final clearing price exceeded your maximum bid price, you'll receive a full USDC refund instead. You can claim tokens and refunds in a single batched transaction.`,
    tag: 'guide',
  },
  {
    q: 'what happens if my bid is outbid?',
    a: `Unlike traditional auctions, you cannot be "outbid" in the conventional sense since everyone pays the same clearing price.

However, if the final clearing price rises above the maximum price you set when bidding, your bid won't be filled and you'll receive a complete USDC refund.

If the clearing price is at or below your max price, you'll receive tokens proportional to your bid amount at the uniform clearing price.`,
    tag: 'rules',
  },
  {
    q: 'why is bidding early beneficial?',
    a: `The auction uses time-weighted calculations that reward earlier participation.

When you bid early, your commitment accumulates more "milli-bips" (allocation units) over the auction duration compared to last-minute bids. This means early bidders receive slightly better token allocations.

The mechanism discourages sniping and creates a more stable auction environment. Early bidding also gives you more time to add additional bids if needed.`,
    tag: 'rules',
  },
  {
    q: 'is this protected from MEV and front-running?',
    a: `Yes, CCAs are inherently MEV-resistant by design.

Since every participant pays the identical final clearing price, there's nothing for bots or validators to extract through front-running or sandwich attacks.

In traditional token sales, front-running a large buy is profitable. In a CCA, the price is determined after all bids are in, making such attacks pointless. The time-weighted mechanism also means late bidders get worse allocations.`,
    tag: 'security',
  },
  {
    q: 'what currencies can i bid with?',
    a: `All auctions on Timelock are denominated in USDC (USD Coin).

You'll need USDC in your wallet on the same network as the auction (Ethereum mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, or Unichain). If you only have ETH or other tokens, swap for USDC first using any DEX.

We chose USDC because it provides stable, predictable pricing and eliminates volatility risk.`,
    tag: 'guide',
  },
  {
    q: 'what happens after the auction ends?',
    a: `Once an auction concludes, several things happen automatically:

First, the final clearing price is calculated and locked in. Then, the raised USDC and tokens are migrated to create a Uniswap V4 liquidity pool at the clearing price.

After migration completes (~20 blocks), claims open for bidders to collect their tokens or refunds. The entire process is trustless and on-chain.`,

  },

const creatorFAQs = [
  {
    q: 'how do i launch a token?',
    a: `Navigate to the /launch page, fill in your token details (name, symbol, description, and optional social links), then deploy with a single transaction.

Behind the scenes, the platform performs "salt mining" in your browser to generate a deterministic deployment address, then creates your token contract and initializes the auction.

You can start the auction immediately or schedule it for a future date. The entire process is permissionless and requires no approval from anyone.`,
    tag: 'guide',
  },
  {
    q: 'what parameters are fixed vs configurable?',
    a: `Timelock uses standardized parameters to ensure fairness. Fixed parameters include:
• Total supply: 1,000,000 tokens
• Auction duration: ~30 minutes
• Floor price: $0.10 per token
• Split: 10% auction, 90% LP

You can configure: token name, symbol, description, social links, and auction start time. This standardization helps bidders easily compare opportunities.`,
    tag: 'config',
  },
  {
    q: 'what does the 10/90 split mean?',
    a: `Of your 1,000,000 token supply, 10% (100,000 tokens) are sold through the auction to establish the initial price and raise USDC.

The remaining 90% (900,000 tokens) are automatically paired with the raised USDC to create deep Uniswap V4 liquidity.

This ensures most tokens are available for trading immediately, creating a healthy liquid market rather than locking supply in team wallets.`,
    tag: 'config',
  },
  {
    q: 'what are the fees for launching?',
    a: `Timelock charges zero protocol fees. You only pay gas costs for deployment.

On Ethereum mainnet this might cost $10-20 at typical gas prices. On L2s like Base or Arbitrum, it's just a few cents.

No ongoing fees, no percentage of raised funds taken. The Uniswap V4 pool has a 1% swap fee, but that goes to liquidity providers (including you).`,
    tag: 'fees',
  },
  {
    q: 'where does the raised USDC go?',
    a: `All USDC raised is automatically paired with tokens to create a Uniswap V4 liquidity pool. This happens trustlessly through smart contracts.

The pool is initialized at the clearing price with full-range liquidity. As the creator, you receive the LP position NFT and earn swap fees from trading activity.

This liquidity cannot be removed immediately, protecting bidders from rug pulls.`,
    tag: 'security',
  },
  {
    q: 'can the liquidity be rugged?',
    a: `No. Liquidity pool creation and locking happens automatically through immutable smart contracts.

When your auction ends, the USDC and tokens are migrated directly into a Uniswap V4 pool. While you receive the LP position NFT, it's locked and cannot be withdrawn.

You benefit from swap fees, but you cannot drain the pool. This eliminates rug-pull risk.`,
    tag: 'security',
  },
  {
    q: 'how do i benefit as a creator?',
    a: `You benefit in several ways:

1. LP Position NFT: You receive the Uniswap V4 LP position, earning a share of 1% swap fees on all trades. This creates ongoing passive income.

2. Token Holdings: You can participate in your own auction like any other bidder.

3. Ecosystem Building: A successful launch builds community and value you can continue developing.`,
    tag: 'fees',
  },
  {
    q: 'what is the floor price?',
    a: `Every token has a floor price of $0.10, translating to a minimum FDV of $100,000 for the 1M token supply.

The clearing price can go higher based on demand, but never lower. This prevents races to the bottom where projects compete on cheapest tokens.

Bidders can bid up to 1000x the floor ($100 per token) as a safety ceiling.`,
    tag: 'config',
  },
  {
    q: 'what if my auction does not get enough bids?',
    a: `If an auction doesn't meet the graduation threshold, all bidders receive complete USDC refunds and no tokens are distributed.

Currently, the graduation threshold is zero, meaning auctions always graduate regardless of amount raised. Even with minimal bids, the pool will be created at floor price.

You can always launch again with a new token if you want to try different timing.`,
    tag: 'rules',
  },
  {
    q: 'which networks are supported?',
    a: `Timelock supports multiple networks:
• Ethereum mainnet
• Base
• Arbitrum
• Unichain

Each network has its own deployed contracts. Your auction runs entirely on the chosen chain, and bidders need assets on that same network.

L2 networks offer significantly lower gas costs for both creators and bidders.`,
    tag: 'guide',
  },
  {
    q: 'is the contract code audited?',
    a: `Yes. The CCA contracts have been audited by leading security firms including Spearbit, OpenZeppelin, and ABDK.

The code is production-ready and has undergone extensive review. There's also an active bug bounty program on Cantina for responsible disclosure.

Contracts use Solidity 0.8.26 with reentrancy guards and established OpenZeppelin patterns.`,
